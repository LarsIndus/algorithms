# Algorithms and Data Structures

In this repository, I practice algorithms and data structures in Python.

Currently, there are four different folders:

* **leetcode**: Solutions for LeetCode problems.
* **searching**: Typical searching algorithms like binary search or linear search, but also graph searching like BFS/DFS.
* **sorting**: Classical sorting algorithms like mergesort or quicksort.
* **misc**: Any random algorithm problem that does not fall in any of the above categories.
